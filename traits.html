	<h1>Jo's Eccentricities</h1>
	<p>Jo is a tall young adult, hovering over all at 6'0 feet tall. He has cat ears for some reason, i don't know why either. He has an energy that is comparable that to of a New York City crackhead outside Penn Station, you don't really know what to expect but you are either afraid or do not acknowledge their existence.<p>
